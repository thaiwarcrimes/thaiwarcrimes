# Getting Started

This archive documents crisis-related events in a **neutral, evidence-first, legally safe** manner.
It tracks incidents on the Thai conflict timeline and contains the contributor + moderator documentation needed to keep the record trustworthy.

---

## Project Scope

- Capture **what happened, where, when, and who was involved**.
- Cite sources for **every claim**; label uncertainty explicitly.
- Publish only **original wording** — no reposted media or headlines.

We are not a news aggregator, advocacy platform, or media repository.
Allowing opinionated or emotional content destroys trust, slows moderation, and creates legal risk for the project and contributors, so such posts are rejected immediately.

## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone the repo.
2. Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` & `docs/contributors/ONBOARDING.md`.
3. Pick or create an event entry. Start from the `docs` tree for examples (the CSV template above helps gather evidence before writing).
4. Open a PR with the project’s pull request template and complete every checklist item.

---

## Moderation Workflow

- Moderators follow the [playbook](./docs/moderation/MODERATOR_PLAYBOOK.md) and [checklist](./docs/moderation/MODERATOR_CHECKLIST.md) on every content change.
- Confidence labels are validated against the [standards](./docs/standards/CONFIDENCE_LEVELS.md).
- High-risk claims or media violations get rejected or escalated immediately.

> **When in doubt, downgrade confidence or request changes.**

## Platform Responsibility

This archive is a public civic record, so the platform must:

- Publish only verifiable facts with cited sources
- Remove or revert any submission that introduces bias, plagiarism, or legal risk
- Stay neutral when documenting conflicts—even when claims are disputed
- Keep detailed moderation notes so decisions remain transparent

Every contributor shares this duty; unsafe content threatens the entire record.

## Guiding Principle

> **Accuracy protects people. Evidence protects truth. Neutrality protects this archive.**

Thank you for helping build a verifiable historical record. Stay careful, stay factual.
