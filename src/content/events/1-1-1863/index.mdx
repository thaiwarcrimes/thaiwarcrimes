title: "Pre-Colonial Khmer–Siam Territorial Dynamics"
date: "Before 1863"
period: "Pre-Colonial Era"
location: "Mainland Southeast Asia (Present-day Cambodia and Thailand)"
summary: >
  Before European colonization, the Khmer Empire was the dominant regional power in
  mainland Southeast Asia, exercising political, cultural, and military control over
  vast territories that today form parts of Thailand. The gradual decline of Khmer power
  enabled the eastward expansion of Siamese kingdoms, resulting in long-term territorial
  losses for Cambodia and shaping future border disputes.

  - event: "Expansion of the Khmer Empire"
    timeframe: "9th–13th centuries"
    description: >
      The Khmer Empire, centered at Angkor, expanded its authority across mainland
      Southeast Asia. Khmer control extended over large parts of present-day eastern and
      northeastern Thailand, including the Khorat Plateau (Isan), Lopburi, Surin, Buriram,
      and areas near the Chao Phraya River basin. Khmer administration, road systems,
      reservoirs, and temple complexes were established throughout these regions.

  - event: "Khmer Cultural and Administrative Presence in Present-day Thailand"
    timeframe: "9th–14th centuries"
    description: >
      Khmer sovereignty and influence are evidenced by hundreds of stone temples
      (prasats), inscriptions in Old Khmer and Sanskrit, baray (water reservoirs), and
      royal roads found across modern Thai territory. Major sites such as Phimai, Phanom
      Rung, and Muang Tam demonstrate direct integration into the Angkorian state rather
      than peripheral influence.

  - event: "Decline of the Khmer Empire"
    timeframe: "14th–15th centuries"
    description: >
      The Khmer Empire began to weaken due to internal succession disputes, overextension,
      environmental stress, economic strain, and repeated military pressure from emerging
      neighboring powers. The sack of Angkor and the gradual abandonment of the Angkor
      region marked a major turning point in Khmer political decline.

  - event: "Rise of Siamese Kingdoms"
    timeframe: "13th–15th centuries"
    description: >
      As Khmer power receded, Siamese polities such as Sukhothai and later Ayutthaya rose to
      prominence. These kingdoms consolidated power in central Thailand and increasingly
      asserted influence over former Khmer-controlled territories to the east.

  - event: "Eastward Expansion of Siam"
    timeframe: "15th–18th centuries"
    description: >
      Siam expanded eastward through military campaigns, political subjugation, and forced
      population movements. Former Khmer territories were gradually absorbed into Siamese
      administrative systems, weakening Cambodia’s territorial control long before the
      arrival of European colonial powers.

  - event: "Long-Term Impact on Cambodian Sovereignty"
    timeframe: "Pre-1863"
    description: >
      By the time France established a protectorate over Cambodia in 1863, significant
      portions of historically Khmer land were already under Siamese control. These
      pre-colonial territorial shifts formed the historical foundation for later border
      disputes, nationalist tensions, and recurring conflicts between Cambodia and
      Thailand.
