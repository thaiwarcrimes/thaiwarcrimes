title: "French Colonial Period"
date: 1863
location: "Cambodia & Thailand"
summary: "In the Franco-Siamese Treaty of 23 March 1907, France and Siam (Thailand) negotiated a major territorial exchange. Siam retroceded the provinces of Battambang, Siem Reap (including Angkor), and Sisophon to French-controlled Cambodia, thereby reintegrating historically Khmer lands into Cambodia. In return, France withdrew from and returned the provinces of Trat and Dan Sai to Siamese control, and both sides agreed to detailed border demarcation efforts. This treaty largely defined the modern Cambodia–Thailand border and set the groundwork for later disputes, such as the Preah Vihear case."
