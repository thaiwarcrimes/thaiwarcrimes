date: 23 March 1907
location: "Cambodia & Thailand"
summary: "In the Franco-Siamese Treaty of 23 March 1907, France and Siam (Thailand) negotiated a major territorial exchange. Siam retroceded the provinces of Battambang, Siem Reap (including Angkor), and Sisophon to French-controlled Cambodia, thereby reintegrating historically Khmer lands into Cambodia. In return, France withdrew from and returned the provinces of Trat and Dan Sai to Siamese control, and both sides agreed to detailed border demarcation efforts. This treaty largely defined the modern Cambodia–Thailand border and set the groundwork for later disputes, such as the Preah Vihear case."

# French Colonial Era and Cambodia–Thailand Border Formation

## Overview

During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Cambodia was under French colonial rule, and its modern borders were shaped through diplomatic treaties between France and Siam (Thailand). These agreements laid the foundation for later border ambiguities and disputes.

---

## The Colonial Actions

French colonial involvement included:

- Establishment of Cambodia as a French protectorate in 1863
- Diplomatic negotiations with Siam to define territorial boundaries
- Creation of official maps and boundary commissions
- Transfer and exchange of territories through formal treaties
- Administrative integration of returned territories into Cambodia

---

## Key Territorial Changes

### 1863 – French Protectorate

- Cambodia placed under French protection
- France assumed responsibility for foreign affairs and border negotiations
- Cambodia lost direct control over border diplomacy

### 1904 – Franco-Siamese Treaty

- France and Siam agreed to preliminary border principles
- A joint boundary commission was established
- Mapping discrepancies later became sources of dispute

### 1907 – Franco-Siamese Treaty (March 23)

- Battambang, Siem Reap, and Sisophon transferred from Siam to French-controlled Cambodia
- Trat and Dan Sai returned by France to Siam
- Treaty largely shaped the modern Cambodia–Thailand border

---

## Impact on Cambodia

The colonial treaties resulted in:

### Territorial Outcomes

- Restoration of historically Khmer provinces to Cambodia
- Formalization of borders based on colonial-era maps
- Loss of Cambodian agency in negotiations

### Administrative Effects

- French colonial administration integrated reclaimed territories
- Borders drawn without local consultation
- Long-term legal and geographic ambiguities

---

## Long-Term Consequences

These arrangements created enduring challenges:

- Ambiguous border demarcation in mountainous regions
- Conflicting interpretations of colonial maps
- Later disputes, including the Preah Vihear case
- Continued reliance on international law to resolve colonial-era legacies

---

## Diplomatic Legacy

The French colonial border-making process:

- Shifted border disputes from local to international arenas
- Anchored Cambodia’s claims in treaty law and colonial documentation
- Established precedents later upheld by the International Court of Justice

---

## Current Relevance

Although Cambodia gained independence in 1953, the borders defined during the French colonial era remain largely intact. Unresolved ambiguities from this period continue to influence Cambodia–Thailand relations, demonstrating the lasting impact of colonial-era decisions.
