title: "Pre-Colonial Relations Between Cambodia and Thailand"
date: "1 January 1863"
location: "Mainland Southeast Asia (Cambodia and present-day Thailand)"
summary: "Before 1863, Cambodia and Thailand (historically Siam) experienced a long and complex relationship shaped by shifting power, territorial expansion, and cultural dominance. Cambodia, through the Khmer Empire, was the earliest and most influential civilization in the region. As Khmer power declined after the 13th century, Siamese kingdoms expanded eastward into historically Khmer territories, laying the foundations for later disputes."

## The Khmer Empire as a Regional Power (9th–13th Centuries)

From the **9th to the early 13th century**, Cambodia—under the **Khmer Empire**—was the dominant political, military, and cultural power in mainland Southeast Asia.

Centered at **Angkor**, the Khmer Empire exercised authority over:
- Present-day **Cambodia**
- Large parts of present-day **Thailand** (including Lopburi, Korat, Surin, Buriram)
- Parts of **Laos** and **southern Vietnam**

During this period:
- No unified Thai state yet existed
- Tai-speaking groups were still migrating southward
- Khmer kings constructed monumental temples such as **Angkor Wat**, **Phimai**, **Phanom Rung**, **Ta Moan**, and **Ta Muen**
- Khmer language, religion (Hinduism and Mahayana Buddhism), irrigation systems, and governance shaped the region

## Decline of Khmer Power and Emergence of Siam (13th–15th Centuries)

From the late **13th century**, the Khmer Empire began to weaken due to:
- Internal succession struggles
- Economic and environmental pressures
- Continuous warfare

At the same time, new Thai polities emerged:
- **Sukhothai Kingdom** (13th century)
- **Ayutthaya Kingdom** (founded in 1351)

As Khmer power declined, **Ayutthaya expanded eastward**, increasingly encroaching upon Khmer-controlled territories.

## Ayutthaya Expansion and Invasions of Cambodia (15th–18th Centuries)

From the **15th century onward**, Siamese–Cambodian relations became increasingly unequal and conflict-driven.

Key developments include:
- **1431**: Ayutthaya captured and sacked **Angkor**, symbolizing the end of Khmer imperial dominance
- Repeated Siamese invasions into Cambodia
- Siamese interference in Cambodian royal succession
- Forced relocation of Cambodian artisans, scholars, and populations into Siam

Cambodia survived as a kingdom but entered a prolonged period of political weakness and instability.

## Cambodia as a Buffer State and Territorial Losses (18th–Early 19th Centuries)

By the **18th and early 19th centuries**:
- Cambodia functioned as a **buffer state** between **Siam (west)** and **Vietnam (east)**
- Cambodia frequently became a **vassal**, paying tribute to one or both powers
- Siam exercised de facto control over historically Khmer regions including:
  - **Battambang**
  - **Siem Reap**
  - **Sisophon**

These territories remained culturally and historically Khmer, despite Siamese political control.

## Pre-Colonial Borders and the Mandala System

Before 1863:
- Borders were not fixed lines as understood in modern international law
- Authority followed the **mandala system**, based on zones of influence rather than sovereignty

However:
- Archaeology, inscriptions, language, and temple distribution clearly demonstrate Khmer civilizational ownership in many contested areas
- Siamese control resulted from later military expansion, not original settlement or cultural origin

## The Road to 1863

By the mid-19th century:
- Cambodia faced continuous pressure from Siam and Vietnam
- Territorial fragmentation threatened Cambodia’s survival as a state

In **1863**, Cambodia accepted **French protection** to:
- Preserve national existence
- Halt further territorial loss
- Seek recovery of historically Khmer lands

This decision marked the end of the **pre-colonial era** and the beginning of the colonial period.

## Historical Significance

The pre-1863 period establishes several historical realities:
- Cambodia was the earliest major civilization in mainland Southeast Asia
- Siam expanded into former Khmer territories during Cambodia’s decline
- Many temples and cultural landmarks in present-day Thailand are Khmer in origin
- Pre-colonial power shifts laid the groundwork for modern border disputes but do not erase Cambodia’s historical and cultural ownership
