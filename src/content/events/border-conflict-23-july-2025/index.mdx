### Summary
Thailand and Cambodia exchanged fire for a second day along their disputed border on Friday, killing at least 17 people and forcing over 135,000 civilians to evacuate. The clashes involved small arms, heavy weapons, rockets, and Thai F-16 airstrikes, with both sides accusing each other of initiating the attacks and concerns raised about the use of cluster munitions. The conflict stems from a long-standing border dispute over territory demarcated by France during Cambodia's colonial period, with tensions escalating after recent incidents including a landmine explosion and a May clash that killed a Cambodian soldier.


### Key Points:

- Casualties: At least 16 people killed in Thailand (mostly civilians) and 1 killed in Cambodia, with several wounded on both sides.
- Mass Evacuations: Over 135,000 people displaced - more than 130,000 Thais evacuated to shelters and over 4,000 Cambodians fled their homes.
- Military Escalation: Thailand deployed F-16 jets and bombed Cambodian military targets. Both sides accused each other of initiating attacks, with concerns raised about Thailand's potential use of cluster munitions.
