The **Cambodian Armed Forces and National Police** will continue to stand **strong, brave, and steadfast**, exercising Cambodia’s inherent right to self-defence to protect the nation’s **territorial integrity, people, and sovereignty**.

## Conclusion

The events of **18 December 2025** confirm Thailand’s continued and escalating armed aggression against Cambodia for the **12th consecutive day**. Through coordinated air, land, naval, and drone operations, Thai forces have gravely endangered civilian lives, cultural heritage, and regional stability.
