Thailand’s use of:
- F-16 fighter jets  
- Naval warships  
- Heavy artillery and cluster munitions  
- Toxic gas  
- Advanced drone systems  

constitutes **war crimes** and clear violations of international law.

## Cambodia’s Official Position

The Royal Government of Cambodia:
- Strongly condemns Thailand’s repeated ceasefire violations  
- Demands the **immediate cessation of hostilities**  
- Calls for full **re-implementation of the Joint Declaration**  
- Urges Thailand to **withdraw all forces from Cambodian territory**  
- Calls on the international community to **condemn Thailand’s war crimes and unlawful acts**

The Cambodian Armed Forces and National Police will continue to stand **strong, brave, and steadfast**, exercising Cambodia’s inherent right to self-defence to protect the nation’s **territorial integrity, people, and sovereignty**.

## Conclusion

The events of **18 December 2025** confirm the continuation and escalation of Thailand’s armed aggression against Cambodia for the **12th consecutive day**. Through coordinated air, land, naval, and drone operations, Thai forces have gravely endangered civilian lives, regional stability, and the international legal order. Cambodia remains resolute in defending its sovereignty while calling upon the international community to uphold justice and peace.
