## Post-Ceasefire Developments (1 August 2025)

In response to international pressure and following the ceasefire agreement, on **1 August 2025**, Thailand **released two Cambodian soldiers** who had been unlawfully detained and were in **critical health condition**.

Cambodia acknowledged the release while reiterating the importance of full compliance with the ceasefire and international humanitarian norms.

## Renewed Ceasefire Violation at An Ses (4 August 2025)

Tensions escalated again on **4 August 2025**, at approximately **11:00 AM**, when **Thai armed forces**, accompanied by **heavy machinery including excavators**, entered the **An Ses area within Cambodian sovereign territory**.

Despite strong objections from Cambodian forces, Thai units:
- **Laid barbed wire**
- Advanced into Cambodian-controlled land  

This action constituted a **flagrant violation of the ceasefire agreement** and posed a serious threat to peace and stability along the border.

## Continued Provocations and Land Alteration (5 August 2025)

On **5 August 2025**, Thai forces continued a series of **deliberate and provocative actions** in the An Ses area:

- **9:09 AM**: Thai forces encroached further into Cambodian territory, using an **excavator to clear land**
- **9:50 AM**: A **concrete-blocked trench** filled with **wheels and logs** was unloaded in front of a Thai post
- **9:53 AM**: **Trench digging resumed**, reinforcing the illegal alteration of the terrain
- **10:55 AM**: Additional **heavy machinery** cleared land behind the police post, approximately **15 meters from Cambodian forces**, while logs and wheels continued to be loaded into the trench

These actions demonstrated a sustained effort to entrench positions inside Cambodian territory in direct violation of ceasefire commitments.

## Cambodia’s Official Position

The Royal Government of Cambodia:
- Strongly condemns all post-ceasefire violations  
- Reaffirms that the An Ses area lies within **Cambodian sovereign territory**  
- Calls for immediate cessation of all illegal activities and withdrawal of heavy machinery  
- Urges strict adherence to the ceasefire agreement and international law  

## Conclusion

Between **1 and 5 August 2025**, Thailand’s actions following the ceasefire—including renewed encroachment, land modification, and the deployment of heavy machinery—undermined confidence-building efforts and threatened regional stability. Cambodia continues to exercise restraint while firmly defending its sovereignty and calling for peaceful, lawful resolution of the border dispute.
