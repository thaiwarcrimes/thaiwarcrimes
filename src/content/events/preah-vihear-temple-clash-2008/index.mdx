## Background

On October 15, 2008, a serious armed confrontation occurred near the ancient Preah Vihear Temple, a UNESCO World Heritage Site located on the Cambodia-Thailand border. The incident marked a significant escalation in the long-standing territorial dispute between the two nations.

## The Incident

Tensions had been building since July 2008, when UNESCO inscribed the temple on its World Heritage List as a Cambodian site. Thailand objected to the inscription, claiming rights to surrounding land.

On the day of the incident:

- Thai and Cambodian troops exchanged fire along the disputed border
- Multiple casualties were reported on both sides
- Civilians in nearby areas were evacuated
- Both nations deployed additional military forces to the region

## International Response

The incident drew international attention, with ASEAN and the United Nations calling for restraint and dialogue. Regional observers expressed concern about the potential for wider conflict.

## Legal Context

The International Court of Justice ruled in 1962 that the temple belongs to Cambodia, but disputes over the surrounding 4.6 square kilometers of land have persisted. The 2008 clash highlighted the fragility of border agreements and the risk of military escalation over unresolved territorial claims.

## Aftermath

Following the clash, both countries engaged in intermittent negotiations while maintaining military presence in the disputed area. The incident set a precedent for future confrontations in the region.
