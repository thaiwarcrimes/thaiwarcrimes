location: "Cambodia–Thailand Border Area and Ta Moan Thom Temple, Oddar Meanchey / Preah Vihear Region, Cambodia"
summary: "In mid-June 2025, Cambodia pursued peaceful diplomatic and legal solutions to escalating border tensions with Thailand. These efforts were met with refusal and non-cooperation from the Thai side. Thailand’s unilateral actions—including economic threats, border closures, political destabilization, and an unauthorized incursion into the Ta Moan Thom temple complex—constituted serious violations of bilateral agreements, Cambodian sovereignty, and established international norms."

By **early June 2025**, Cambodia actively sought a **peaceful resolution** to escalating border tensions through diplomatic negotiations with Thailand. These initiatives reflected Cambodia’s commitment to dialogue, regional stability, and respect for international law.

Despite these efforts, the Thai side **refused to cooperate**, declining meaningful engagement and contributing to a worsening situation along the border.

## Defensive Economic Measures (12–22 June 2025)

Between **12 and 22 June 2025**, Cambodia implemented **defensive economic measures** in response to Thailand’s escalating threats and unilateral actions. These measures included:

- Temporary suspension of imports from Thailand  
- Responses to Thai threats to block:
  - Fuel supplies  
  - Internet connectivity  
  - Electricity transmission  
- Reaction to Thailand’s **unilateral border closure**

These actions were undertaken strictly to safeguard Cambodia’s national security, economic stability, and civilian welfare.

## Ta Moan Thom Temple Violation (22 June 2025)

On **22 June 2025**, at approximately **7:30 AM**, **three Thai soldiers** led a group of around **150 Thai cyclists** into the **Ta Moan Thom temple complex** without prior notification to the Cambodian side.

This act constituted a **clear violation of the bilateral agreement**, which stipulates that:
- Temple visiting hours are limited to **9:00 AM – 3:00 PM**
- Advance coordination with Cambodian authorities is mandatory

The unauthorized entry represented a direct infringement of Cambodian sovereignty and further escalated tensions in the sensitive border area.

## Official Position

The Royal Government of Cambodia strongly condemns these actions and reiterates its firm commitment to resolving all border disputes through **peaceful, legal, and diplomatic means**, while maintaining its inherent right to protect national sovereignty and territorial integrity.

## Conclusion

Throughout June 2025, Cambodia consistently pursued dialogue, restraint, and international legal mechanisms. Thailand’s refusal to cooperate, combined with economic pressure, political instability, and on-the-ground provocations, significantly contributed to the deterioration of bilateral relations and increased risks to regional stability.
