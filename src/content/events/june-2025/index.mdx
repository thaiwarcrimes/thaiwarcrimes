summary: "In mid-June 2025, Cambodia pursued peaceful diplomatic and legal solutions to escalating border tensions with Thailand. These efforts were met with refusal and non-cooperation from the Thai side. Thailand’s unilateral actions—including economic threats, border closures, political destabilization, and an unauthorized incursion into the Ta Moan Thom temple complex—constituted serious violations of bilateral agreements, Cambodian sovereignty, and established international norms."

## Ta Moan Thom Temple Violation (22 June 2025)

On **22 June 2025**, at approximately **7:30 AM**, **three Thai soldiers** led a group of around **150 Thai cyclists** into the **Ta Moan Thom temple complex** without prior notification to the Cambodian side.

This act constituted a **clear violation of the bilateral agreement**, which stipulates that:

## Conclusion

Thailand’s refusal to cooperate, combined with economic pressure, political instability, and on-the-ground provocations, significantly contributed to the deterioration of bilateral relations and increased risks to regional stability.
