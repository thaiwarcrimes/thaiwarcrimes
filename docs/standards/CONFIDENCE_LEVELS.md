# Confidence Levels & Verification Standards

This archive uses **confidence levels** to clearly communicate **how certain a claim is**.

This prevents misinformation, avoids false certainty, and builds long-term trust.

---

## 🎯 Why Confidence Levels Matter

- Crises evolve quickly
- Information is often incomplete
- Different sources may disagree

Confidence levels make uncertainty **explicit**, not hidden.

---

## 🧩 Confidence Level Definitions

### 🟢 CONFIRMED
**Definition**
- Verified by multiple independent, reliable sources
- Or confirmed by official statements with no credible dispute

**Minimum requirements**
- ≥2 reputable sources  
  OR  
- 1 official statement + independent confirmation

**Example**
> Confirmed by statements from both governments and corroborated by international media.

---

### 🔵 HIGH CONFIDENCE
**Definition**
- Strong evidence from reliable sources
- Minor details may still be unclear

**Minimum requirements**
- 1 reputable source  
- No credible contradictory evidence

**Example**
> Reported by a major news outlet citing official military sources.

---

### 🟡 MEDIUM CONFIDENCE
**Definition**
- Partial verification
- Information is plausible but incomplete

**Minimum requirements**
- 1 source of moderate reliability  
- Or multiple weak sources pointing to the same facts

**Required labeling**
- Must clearly state what is unknown

**Example**
> Multiple local reports describe the incident, but official confirmation is pending.

---

### 🟠 LOW CONFIDENCE
**Definition**
- Limited or weak evidence
- Claims may change as more information emerges

**Minimum requirements**
- Single weak source (e.g. social media, anonymous account)

**Required labeling**
- Must explicitly say *“unverified”* or *“cannot be independently confirmed”*

---

### 🔴 UNVERIFIED / DISPUTED
**Definition**
- Conflicting claims
- No reliable confirmation
- Or active denial by credible parties

**Usage**
- These entries are allowed **only if clearly labeled**
- Must present **all known sides**

**Example**
> Claims could not be independently verified and are disputed by opposing statements.

## 🔄 Updating Confidence Levels

Confidence levels are **not permanent**.

They should be:
- Upgraded when new evidence appears
- Downgraded if evidence is challenged
- Revised transparently via PRs

---

## 🧪 Moderator Rules

Moderators will:
- Reject overconfident labeling
- Require downgrades if evidence is weak
- Ask contributors to justify confidence levels

---

## Guiding Principle

> **When in doubt, downgrade.  
> Overconfidence harms credibility more than uncertainty.**
