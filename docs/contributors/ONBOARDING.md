## What This Archive Is (and Isn’t)

### This archive **IS**
- A factual event timeline
- Evidence-driven
- Neutral and calm
- Transparent about uncertainty

### This archive **IS NOT**
- A news aggregator
- An opinion or advocacy platform
- A place to repost media
- A social media feed

## 10-Minute First Contribution Guide

### Step 1: Check if the event already exists
Search the repository for:
- The same date
- The same location
- The same incident

If it exists → **add an update or evidence**  
If not → **create a new event entry**

> Tip: copy `docs/templates/event_submission_template.csv` into your own spreadsheet or Google Sheet to capture one event per row before writing Markdown.

---

### Step 2: Write in your own words
Answer these questions simply:

- What happened?
- When did it happen?
- Where did it happen?
- Who was involved?
- How do we know?

Keep it short. Clarity beats length.

---

### Step 3: Add sources
Every factual claim needs:
- A **link to a source**, or
- A clear label like *“unconfirmed”* or *“disputed”*

**Preferred sources**
- Official statements
- Reputable journalism
- Independent investigations

**Use carefully**
- Social media
- Anonymous accounts  
(Always label clearly.)

---

### Step 4: Do NOT upload media
You must **never upload**:
- Images
- Videos
- Screenshots
- PDFs

Use **links or embeds only**

---

### Step 5: Open a Pull Request
- Use the project PR template
- Complete **all checkboxes**
- Missing checkboxes = automatic failure

---

## What a Good Contribution Looks Like

**Good**
> On 12 January 2025, Cambodian officials reported an exchange of fire near the Preah Vihear border area. Thai military representatives stated they were responding to an unidentified incursion. Independent verification was not immediately available.

**Bad**
> Thailand brutally attacked Cambodia again in a shameful act of aggression.

## Common Reasons PRs Are Rejected

- Missing sources
- Emotional or biased language
- Long copied text
- Re-uploaded images or videos
- Claims without evidence
- Unchecked PR checklist

Rejections are **not personal** — they protect the archive.
