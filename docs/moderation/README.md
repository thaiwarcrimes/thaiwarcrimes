# Moderation Hub

This is the central index for all moderator resources in the archive.

All moderator-facing references now live inside `/docs/moderation`.
Use this page as your starting point before reviewing any pull request.

## Quick Links

| Document | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [Moderator Playbook](./MODERATOR_PLAYBOOK.md) | End-to-end guidance on how to review safely, consistently, and without legal expertise |
| [Moderator Review Checklist](./MODERATOR_CHECKLIST.md) | One-page checklist applied to every content-changing PR |
| [Confidence Levels & Verification Standards](../standards/CONFIDENCE_LEVELS.md) | Defines when a claim counts as CONFIRMED, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, or UNVERIFIED |

## How to Use These Docs

1. **Start with the Playbook.** It explains the moderation principles, high-risk triggers, and the “30-second rule.”
2. **Apply the Checklist.** Use it line-by-line before approving or rejecting a PR.  
3. **Reference the Standards.** If a claim feels uncertain, double-check the confidence requirements before making a decision.

## Standard Moderation Flow

1. Scan for out-of-scope or unsafe contributions (media uploads, advocacy, propaganda).  
2. Validate sources, wording, and confidence levels against the standards.  
3. Decide: approve, request changes, or reject — always explain the reasoning in the PR thread.  
4. Log or escalate anything that feels high-risk or unclear.

## Supporting Material

- [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) — baseline rules every contributor and moderator must enforce  
- [Contributor Onboarding](../contributors/ONBOARDING.md) — shows contributors what to expect so your feedback stays consistent with the guidance they read  
- [Project README](../../README.md) — overview of the archive’s mission and scope

If moderation needs evolve, update this hub first so contributors and moderators always know where the canonical references live.
