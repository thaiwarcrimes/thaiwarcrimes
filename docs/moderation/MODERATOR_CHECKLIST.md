## 1. Scope Check (Fail Fast)

Reject immediately if the PR:
- Contains opinions, advocacy, slogans, or calls to action
- Re-hosts images, videos, PDFs, or screenshots
- Copies articles, headlines, or long excerpts
- Is clearly propaganda or emotionally charged

If any apply → **Reject with explanation**

---

## 2. Source Verification

For **each factual claim**, confirm:

- [ ] Source link is present
- [ ] Source is clearly identified (official / media / other)
- [ ] Weak sources are explicitly labeled
- [ ] Claims are attributed (“according to…”, “reported by…”)

Missing sources → **Request changes**

---

## 3. Evidence Quality

Check evidence strength:

- [ ] Official statement or reputable reporting
- [ ] Independent corroboration (if CONFIRMED or HIGH)
- [ ] Disputes are clearly stated
- [ ] No speculation presented as fact

If evidence does **not** support confidence level → **Downgrade or request edit**

---

## 4. Confidence Level Validation

Verify assigned confidence level matches evidence:

| Level | Evidence Required |
|------|------------------|
| CONFIRMED | Multiple independent reliable sources |
| HIGH | One strong reputable source |
| MEDIUM | Partial / incomplete confirmation |
| LOW | Single weak source |
| UNVERIFIED | Conflicting or denied claims |

Overconfident labeling → **Must be downgraded**

---

## 5. Neutrality & Language

Confirm language is:
- [ ] Neutral and factual
- [ ] Free of inflammatory wording
- [ ] Clear about uncertainty
- [ ] Avoids assigning intent unless sourced

Biased tone → **Request rewrite**

---

## 6. Copyright & Legal Safety

Confirm:
- [ ] No uploaded media
- [ ] No verbatim headlines
- [ ] Quotes are short and attributed
- [ ] No article-style reproduction

Legal risk → **Reject or require rewrite**

---

## 7. Structure & Clarity

Check the entry answers:
- [ ] What happened
- [ ] When
- [ ] Where
- [ ] Who
- [ ] Evidence
- [ ] Status / confidence

Missing clarity → **Request changes**

---

## 8. Decision Outcome

Choose **one**:

- **Approve & merge**
- **Request changes** (be specific)
- **Reject** (cite violated principle)

Always reference:
- CONTRIBUTING.md section
- Confidence level standard (if relevant)

## Moderator Principle

> **When uncertain, ask for evidence.
> When evidence is weak, downgrade.
> When risk is high, reject.**
