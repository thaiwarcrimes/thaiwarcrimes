# Moderator Playbook

Use this playbook to review submissions **safely, consistently, and quickly** without legal expertise.

> Start at the [moderation hub](./README.md) for context and quick links.
> For the final pass on each PR, run through the [Moderator Review Checklist](./MODERATOR_CHECKLIST.md).

**Golden rule:** *We publish facts + links, not other people’s content.*

---

## 1. The 30-Second Rule (Initial Scan)

Before reading details, ask:

* Are **sources included**?
* Is the text **clearly written in original words**?
* Are there **images or videos uploaded**?

**If any answer is NO → stop and request changes.**

---

## 2. What We Are Allowed to Publish (Safe Zone)

**OK to publish**

* Original summaries of events (own words)
* Dates, locations, timelines
* Links to news articles, statements, videos
* Embedded content (YouTube embed, not reupload)
* Short quotes **only when necessary**, with source

**Never publish**

* Copied headlines or paragraphs
* News images downloaded from websites
* Reuploaded videos or screenshots
* Paywalled or leaked material

**If you see copied media → reject immediately.**

---

## 3. Title Rule (Very Important)

Do **NOT** copy the original news headline.
Always write a **neutral factual title**.

**Bad:**

> “Thailand Commits War Crimes at Border”

**Good:**

> “Border incident reported near [location] on [date]”

---

## 4. Claims vs Facts Check

Ask:

* Is this stated as a **fact** or a **claim**?

**Rules:**

* Facts = observable, confirmed (who/where/when)
* Claims = accusations, intent, responsibility

Claims must:

* Be clearly labeled (“reported by…”, “according to…”)
* Have a credible source link

Never present accusations as proven facts.

---

## 5. High-Risk Content (Needs Extra Care)

Mark **HIGH RISK** if any apply:

* War crimes or criminal accusations
* Named individuals or organizations blamed
* Graphic violence
* Only one weak source

**HIGH RISK REQUIREMENTS**

* At least **2 moderator approvals**
* Strong wording review (neutral, factual)
* Clear uncertainty labels

If unsure → **do not merge**.

---

## 6. Media Checklist (Strict)

If media is included, check:

* Is it uploaded to the repo? → Reject
* Is it a news photo? → Reject
* Is it an embed from the original platform? → OK
* Is it contributor’s own photo/video? → OK (ask confirmation)

**Rule of thumb:**
*If we didn’t create it, don’t host it.*

---

## 7. Language & Tone Check

Content must be:

* Neutral
* Factual
* Non-provocative

Remove:

* Emotional language
* Calls for violence or boycott
* Insults or political slogans

We document events — we do not campaign.

---

## 8. Decision Matrix

| Situation          | Action          |
| ------------------ | --------------- |
| Minor issues       | Request changes |
| Copied content     | Reject          |
| Missing sources    | Request changes |
| Legal risk unclear | Hold / escalate |
| Clean + compliant  | Merge           |

Always leave a short moderator note.

---

## 9. After Merge Safety Check

Before final merge:

* [ ] Sources visible on page
* [ ] Title is neutral
* [ ] No hosted copyrighted media
* [ ] “Report an issue” link present

---

## 10. Takedown Rule (Very Important)

If anyone reports a legal issue:

1. **Unpublish first**
2. Review calmly
3. Remove or restore with reason
4. Log the action

Never argue publicly about copyright.

---

## When in Doubt

Ask yourself:

> “Would this still be safe if the publisher’s lawyer read it?”

If unsure → **don’t merge**.

---

### Remember

You are **protecting the project**, not judging the truth of the world.

*Facts + links + original words = safe.*
